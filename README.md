This is a blood cancer classification app developed using tkinter.
It classifies ALL into 4 types.

4. Malignant_early Pre-B'

To run the blood-cancer-classifier-app.
1. Download the project as Zip File
2. Extract the zip file
3. I've shared the link for dataset and ML model --> download it and save it in same directory as blood-cancer-classifier-app.py
4. open vs code in current directory
5. In a new terminal run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to download the necessary requirements.
6. Run the python file and you can upload the images and check for the classification.

PS: Please check the rename the dataset folder as there is a mistake in naming of Dataset folder.
for this you can try to test 4-5 images from each folder and rename folder accordingly.

Hope this might be useful for you!!!
